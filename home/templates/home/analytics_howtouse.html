    <h1>How to Use the Analytics Platform</h1>
    <h3> How to Generate the Graph</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>In 'Date Range', add your start and end date. For example: 1st of November 2011 to 1st of December 2011.
            Note that there is no data beyond May 2015.</li>
        <li>In 'Event Selection' select a date from the 'Choose a Date' drop down menu. If drop down menu is blank,
            that means there is no available data in between the dates you have chosen.</li>
        <li>Choose an event listed in the 'Choose an Event' drop down menu.
            Only after all of this data (Steps 2,3) has been
            specified will the 'RIC Selection' section appear.
            <br>
            An example of an event involving multiple RICs is the <i> 5th of December 2012 </i>
            <br>
            <code>Please note, there is some delay involved in loading a large number of RICs and thier respective data.</code>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>In 'RIC Selection', choose the RICs you wish to appear on the graph. After this, the graph will appear
            at the top of the page.</li>
    </ol></p>
    <h3> How to Use the Graph</h3>
    <p>
        The graph will display the data of the RICs chosen over the date range chosen, as well as the average of all
        of the RICs that are currently being displayed on the graph. Hover the mouse over the graph to show the exact
        cumulative returns for a particular date for all the RICs and the 'average' is also displayed. Clicking on the
        graph at a particular point will rescale the RICs to 0% on that date, and show the data relative to that date.
        <br>
        Please note that if only one RIC is chosen no average will be shown. Also, some of the dates in the data have
        no data associated with them. For these dates, there will be unexpected results (such as sudden dips in the graph).
